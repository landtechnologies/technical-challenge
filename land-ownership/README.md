# Challenge: Corporate Land Ownership

## Guidelines

Spend a **maximum of 3 hours** on this challenge.

Your time is valuable, so DO FOCUS ON:

- Demonstrating clarity of thought.
- Demonstrating mastery of your chosen language.
- Making sure your solution is easy to run, easy to understand, and has a well-tested core.

We DON'T CARE about:

- Peripheral configuration/boilerplate code.
- Production-readiness.
- Enterprise-readiness.

You can use any tech stack, but for reference we use node.js, python, shell and docker.

You may wish to have a quick read of [Our Engineering Principles](https://engineering.land.tech/principles) and [Our Tech Radar](https://engineering.land.tech/radar/).

Particularly in this tech-challenge scenario, **less is more**.

## Background

In the UK, most land is owned by private individuals, but plenty of land is owned by companies. Here we are interested specifically in land-owning companies and their land.

Most land-owning companies are small and simple, but others exhibit complex legal structures. For example, Sainsburys (the supermarket) owns several thousand parcels of
land in England and Wales, but its top-level legal entity, "J Sainsbury PLC", only owns about 40 parcels directly, all the other land is owned by sub-companies and sub-sub-companies etc. These
corporate structures arise from company mergers and acquisitions, as well as by design (for legal/financial reasons).

## Available Data

We have provided two files of dummy data in this directory.

`company_relations.csv`:

| company id | name                               | parent |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| C2013      | Acme Land Ltd                      |        |
| C71299     | Jacksons Stores Limited            | C4012  |
| C4012      | J Sainsbury PLC                    |        |
| C45353     | Jacksons Stores Manchester Limited | C71299 |
| ...        |                                    |        |

and `land_ownership.csv`:

| land parcel id | owning company id |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| T54343         | C4012             |
| T8871          | C4012             |
| T12130         | C2013             |
| ...            |                   |

## Task

Our real-world end-users want a tool to visualize the corporate structure and quantity of land ownership for any given land-owning company.

However this is a tech-challenge not the real world, so we'd just like to see a basic command-line interface backed by in-memory data structures (no servers or databases please). Also, while we are happy for you to show off your creativity in terms of addressing the end-user need, we would at least like to see the total (direct+indirect) amount of land owned by the companies of interest.

It's ok to make assumptions, but do tell us why you went in a particular direction (you can also email us - engineering@land.tech).

## Suggested Approach

We suggest that the cli tool accepts a company id and prints out a partially-expanded tree like this:

```
> landtree --mode=from_root C45353
C4012; J Sainsbury PLC; owner of 400 land parcels
  | -  C12332; Sainsbury London; owner of 100 land parcels
  | -  C71299; Jacksons Stores Limited; owner of 14 land parcels
  | | - C45353; Jacksons Stores Manchester Limited; owner of 2 land parcels ***
  | | - C91123; Jacksons Stores Coventry Limited; owner of 1 land parcel
  | - C555123; Best products; owner of 13 land parcels
  | - C712933; 24 Hour Food Local Norfolk; owner of 1 land parcels
```

Note how we specify `--mode=from_root`, which provides the tree "from the root" down to the company in question, leaving other areas of the tree not expanded.
The "owner of X land parcels" bit states the total count of all parcels owned by the company and its sub companies.

The next step might be to support expanding parts of the tree. For example:

```
> landtree --mode=expand C555123
| - C623354; Best products Children Ltd; owner of 2 land parcels
| - C555123; Best products Metro; owner of 9 land parcels
```

Loading CSVs into memory isn't terribly exciting, so we suggest just copy-pasting one of these snippets and then moving on to the core of the problem:

**Node**

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
fs.readFileSync("./company_relations.csv", "utf8")
  .split("\n")
  .slice(1) // header row
  .forEach((line) => {
    const [id, name, parentId] = line.split(",");
    // ... do something with the data
  });

fs.readFileSync("./land_ownership.csv", "utf8")
  .split("\n")
  .slice(1) // header row
  .forEach((line) => {
    const [landId, companyId] = line.split(",");
    // ... do something with the data
  });
```

**Python**

```python
with open("./company_relations.csv") as csv:
  next(csv) # header
  for line in csv:
    id, name, parentId = line.split(",")
    # ... do something with the data

with open("./land_ownership.csv") as csv:
  next(csv) # header
  for line in csv:
    landId, companyId = line.split(",")
    # ... do something with the data
```

## Bonus Considerations

If you have time, we would be interested in your thoughts (just thoughts) on the real-world scenario. Note that ultimately the solution would need to handle a few tens of requests per second, work with tens of millions of land parcels, hundreds of thousands of companies, and company structures that contain a couple of thousand constituent legal entities.

Also, the real-world data is messier than the sample data here. You might like to consider one or more of the following real-world cases:

- company X is owned 50% by company Y and 50% by company Z.
- company X is owned 50% by each of Y and Z, but Z also owns 25% of company Y.
- company X is 25% owned by company Y, but company Y is 25% owned by company X (this does happen!)

You could also think about other features that the end-user might need. For example, end users might want to know about ownership within a very specific region of the country rather than the whole UK.
